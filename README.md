# Lin_reg_car_pred_

Here I have uploaded two models for the same data, using different approach<br>

## First One
In the first one, I have kept some more features, and have not appplied any scaling. I have also treated the outliers in the first one.<br>
So I have got 78% accuracy in the first model.<br>
## Second One
In the second one , I have selected the features using VIF  and applied scaling. I have got 76% accuracy in this. 
Still need to do some more research. But now I will take another data and kept my research going.
